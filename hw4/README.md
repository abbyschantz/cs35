cs35 homework 4

This homework looks at learning about machine learning by analyzing three datasets. 
Problem 3, for example, looks at data from titanic to predict if the unknown people 
survived or not. Using kNN, titanic.py models the survival of some of the passengers 
on the Titanic. We used 10-fold cross valitation to determine a n_neighbors model 
parameter that performed best.
